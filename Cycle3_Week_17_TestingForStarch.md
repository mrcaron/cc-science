# Week 17 : Science : Organic Chemistry

The experiment features The Iodine Test, which is very rich in potential to dive deep. The caution is to keep things simple so that you can do a quick deep dive in five to ten minutes while not making the kids bored out of their minds!

We start with the question, "Why does it change to a blue color?" And we can start to answer it within our Chemistry context. We can start with talking about what a starch is, chemically speaking; and what iodine is, chemically speaking. Then we can get into the reaction of those molecules.

## Grammar

* Carbohydrate
  * "a fancy way of saying 'sugar'"
  * Carbon (C) atoms bonded to hydroxide (OH-) ion groups.
  * consists of C, H and O atoms, usually with twice as much H as O. Takes form of C<sub>m</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>n</sub> where _m_ and _n_ are integers.
  * Plants can create long chains of these molecules for food storage or structural reasons (_polysaccharide_)
  * Called organic because it's made up of a long chain of carbon atoms.
* Saccharide
  * a word that scientists use to describe sugars
  * mono- (1 sugar molecule)
   * **Glucose** (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>) is the most important _mono_-saccharide on Earth. It's made by plants in photosynthesis. ![Glucose structure](http://www.chem4kids.com/files/art/bio_glucose.png) ![Glucose structure](http://www.visionlearning.com/img//library/modules/mid61/Image/VLObject-798-021205011212.gif)
    * **Fructose** has the same molecular formula, but a different structure. It's an _isomer_ of glucose. ![Fructose Structure](http://www.visionlearning.com/img//library/modules/mid61/Image/VLObject-799-021205011212.gif)
  * di- (2 sugar molecules)
  * tri- (3 sugar molecules)
  * poly- (*) many
* Starch
  * A _starch_ is a complex-carbohydrate consisting of a large number of glucose molecules joined by [glycosidic bonds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycosidic_bond) (that is a covalent bond!), in other words, it's a _polymer_ of glucose. It's 20-30% [amylose](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amylose) and 70-80% [amylopectin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amylopectin)
  * _AKA_ Amylum
  * It's a _polysaccharide_, a long chain of sugar molecules ![Starch Molecule](http://www.visionlearning.com/img//library/modules/mid61/Image/VLObject-801-021205011213.gif)
  * Plants store energy in starches, so when we eat them, we have access to that energy! (Tie it to Anatomy) - When we eat starches, an enzyme that occurs in saliva and in the intestines called _amylase_ breaks the bonds between the repeating glucose units, thus allowing the sugar to be absorbed into the bloodstream. This is why, if you eat a saltine cracker and you just keep chewing it in your mouth without swallowing it, it becomes sweet.
* Polymer
  * A large molecule consisting of  reoccurring units of a smaller molecule
  * Can be thought of as a chain in which small molecules called monomers form the links
  * One can observe polymers using an _atomic force microscope_!
* Monomer
  * Any molecule that may become chemically bonded to other molecules of the same type to form a larger molecule called a _polymer_.

* Iodine
* Potassium Iodide
* glucose
* Isotope Profiling
* Chromatography
* Colloidal dispersion
* insoluble
* alpha acetal linkage

## Talking Points

This particular experiment highlights testing for starch, which has a few practical applications to talk about, namely:

* Testing for counterfeit dollar bills
* Brewing

Starch is a mixture of **amylose** (10-20%) and **amylopectin** (80%-90%). Amylose forms a spiral like a coiled spring because of the bond angles. An aqueous solution of potassium iodide


Iodine slides into the amylose coil to give it a blue-black color. More specifically,

> Iodine is not very soluble in water, therefore the iodine reagent is made by dissolving iodine in water in the presence of potassium iodide. This makes a linear triiodide ion complex which is soluble. The triiodide ion slips into the coil of the starch causing an intense blue-black color.
