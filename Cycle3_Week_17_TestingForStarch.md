# Week 17 : Science : Organic Chemistry

## Overview 

The experiment features The Iodine Test, which is very rich in potential to dive deep. The caution is to keep things simple so that you can do a quick deep dive in five to ten minutes while not making the kids bored out of their minds!

We start with the question, "Why does it change to a blue color?" And we can start to answer it within our Chemistry context, with a slight nod to both Physics and Anatomy. Physics: Light is [electromagnetic radiation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation) and certain wavelenths are [visible to the human eye](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_spectrum). Anatomy: We perceive color in our brains because, remember kids when we were talking about the _retina_ and how it has _cones and rods_? Those cones and rods tingle and twitch in various ways with the wavelengths of light that hit them, sending pulses through our nerves to our brains to tell us that the apple we're going to eat is shiny red. Back to Physics: We "see" because we percieve the electromagnetic radiation eminating from objects. Certain objects absorb more light than others, radiating differently. If you touch the wall, then remove your hand and look at it with an Infrared lens, you'll see that there is now a different radiation on the wall where your hand used to be. If you look at the sky during the day, you see blue because there's nothing in the air to absorb the wavelength of blue light passing through our atmosphere, yet at sundown, there's more in the air and the wavelength gets turned down and we see red. So when we look at this experiment and see **Blue**, we are observing a change in the radiation of light from the object we're testing. Why? Well... let's turn to Chemistry.

Chemically speaking, we're talking about Starch and Iodine (actually Potassium Iodide). A Starch molecule... etc. etc. and has a spiral shape because of the bonding of it's atoms. Potassium Iodide forms these links of 3-iodine molecules like little rods that pass into the hole of the spiral. Prior to the Potassium Iodide, light was absorbed/radiated by starch in a certain way, then we added the reagant and we now have a different light absorbtion/radiation. The reagant doesn't interact with any other molecule this way, ONLY starch, which is why this test can be used to detect if an object contains starch, like when people test a dollar bill. Dollar bills are made with a special fabric that is actually not paper, it is starchless. If you put this stuff on a dollar bill, it won't change color. However, ameteur counterfeiters will use a regular paper to print their money on and if you apply this test, you'll get a blue color. That's one of the reasons, when you give a $100 bill at a store, they will rub it with a particular highlighter (this isn't an iodine pen, of course, they are using a different chemical reaction as the test, but the principle is the same). 

During the experiment, give each student a Saltine cracker. Tell them to chew it without swallowing until they taste it becoming sweet. They are observing the process of their saliva (containing _amylase_ enzymes) breaking apart the starch polymer chain into it's glucose units. A chemical reaction in their mouth!

## Grammar

* Carbohydrate
  * "a fancy way of saying 'sugar'"
  * Carbon (C) atoms bonded to hydroxide (OH-) ion groups.
  * consists of C, H and O atoms, usually with twice as much H as O. Takes form of C<sub>m</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>n</sub> where _m_ and _n_ are integers.
  * Plants can create long chains of these molecules for food storage or structural reasons (_polysaccharide_)
  * Called organic because it's made up of a long chain of carbon atoms.
* Saccharide
  * a word that scientists use to describe sugars
  * mono- (1 sugar molecule)
   * **Glucose** (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>) is the most important _mono_-saccharide on Earth. It's made by plants in photosynthesis. ![Glucose structure](http://www.chem4kids.com/files/art/bio_glucose.png) ![Glucose structure](http://www.visionlearning.com/img//library/modules/mid61/Image/VLObject-798-021205011212.gif)
    * **Fructose** has the same molecular formula, but a different structure. It's an _isomer_ of glucose. ![Fructose Structure](http://www.visionlearning.com/img//library/modules/mid61/Image/VLObject-799-021205011212.gif)
  * di- (2 sugar molecules)
  * tri- (3 sugar molecules)
  * poly- (*) many
* Starch
  * A _starch_ is a complex-carbohydrate consisting of a large number of glucose molecules joined by [glycosidic bonds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycosidic_bond) (that is a covalent bond!), in other words, it's a _polymer_ of glucose. It's 20-30% [amylose](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amylose) and 70-80% [amylopectin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amylopectin)
  * _AKA_ Amylum
  * It's a _polysaccharide_, a long chain of sugar molecules ![Starch Molecule](http://www.visionlearning.com/img//library/modules/mid61/Image/VLObject-801-021205011213.gif)
  * Plants store energy in starches, so when we eat them, we have access to that energy! (Tie it to Anatomy) - When we eat starches, an enzyme that occurs in saliva and in the intestines called _amylase_ breaks the bonds between the repeating glucose units, thus allowing the sugar to be absorbed into the bloodstream. This is why, if you eat a saltine cracker and you just keep chewing it in your mouth without swallowing it, it becomes sweet.
* Polymer
  * A large molecule consisting of  reoccurring units of a smaller molecule
  * Can be thought of as a chain in which small molecules called monomers form the links
  * One can observe polymers using an _atomic force microscope_!
* Monomer
  * Any molecule that may become chemically bonded to other molecules of the same type to form a larger molecule called a _polymer_.

* Iodine
* Potassium Iodide
* glucose
* Isotope Profiling
* Chromatography
* Colloidal dispersion
* insoluble
* alpha acetal linkage

## Talking Points

This particular experiment highlights testing for starch, which has a few practical applications to talk about, namely:

* Testing for counterfeit dollar bills
* Brewing

Starch is a mixture of **amylose** (10-20%) and **amylopectin** (80%-90%). Amylose forms a spiral like a coiled spring because of the bond angles. An aqueous solution of potassium iodide


Iodine slides into the amylose coil to give it a blue-black color. More specifically,

> Iodine is not very soluble in water, therefore the iodine reagent is made by dissolving iodine in water in the presence of potassium iodide. This makes a linear triiodide ion complex which is soluble. The triiodide ion slips into the coil of the starch causing an intense blue-black color.
