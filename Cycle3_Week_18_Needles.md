# Week 18 Science: "Needles"

From [eHow](http://www.ehow.com/how-does_5750721_do-epsom-salt-crystals-form_.html): 
> When growing Epsom salt crystals, the first step involves dissolving salt in hot water. 
> Hot water is important because the temperature of the water has a direct effect on the amount 
> of salt that can be dissolved in it. Heat increases the amount of space available between 
> molecules and, as a result, hot water will hold more salt than cold water. Dissolving is not a 
> chemical change either: water is simply pulling the salt atoms apart and not changing the actual 
> salt molecules themselves.
> 
> When no more salt can dissolve in water, the solution is considered saturated because all the 
> available molecular space has been filled. When the solution begins to cool, the space between 
> the molecules decreases and the salt is slowly pushed out as a solid, which is also the beginning 
> of crystal formation. Furthermore, the evaporation of water hastens the crystal formation process. 
> Evaporation is the process in which water becomes a gas and rises. Epsom salt, which does not change 
> states as easily as water does, remains behind in its solid form, resulting in long needle-like 
> formations.
