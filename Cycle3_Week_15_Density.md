# "Magic Solution" : Density

## Grammar

* **Mass** - Mass, measured in _grams_, is a fundamental property of matter that measures the amount of matter in that substance. It is a measurement of resistance to acceleration. It is roughly equivilant to the number of atoms in a object combined with the density of those atoms.
    * Mass is not the same as weight, though we can figure out the mass of something by comparing an object's weight with that of the weight of some known object using a balance (like comparing a gram of steel with the unknown mass).
    * Mass doesn't have anything to do with the size of something
    * Mass is measured by determining the extent to which a particle or object resists a change in direction or speed when a force is applied. `F = ma`
* **Weight** is the _force_ of gravity on an object and can be thought of as mass times the acceleration of gravity. We can use gravity in Newton's Law to solve for mass. 
* **Density** - Density, also referred to as _Specific Gravity_, is the mass per unit volume of a substance, measured in kilograms per cubic metre; i.e. it's the "weight" for a chosen amount (volume) of material. Density is similar to saying how tighly packed together the atoms of a substance are. Floatation is directly related to density. 
* **Buoyancy** - the ability or tendency to float in water or air or some other fluid

## Talking Points / Demonstrations

* In one case, we notice that the egg is not floating, in another we see the egg floating. So what's the deal? We should start first with the question, "Why does something float at all?"
	* We've seen that stuff is made of atoms
	* Every atom has an atomic mass and as gravity acts on the atoms, they have weight
	* Different substances contain different numbers of atoms in the same space, i.e. they have different _densities_. 
	* Salt water is more dense than fresh water because in the same container, it contains both the water and the salt
	* For something to float, it must have a density less than in what it is floating. Steam floats in air (less dense); clouds float.
	* Ships float, though steel is more dense than the water because when you take the entire ship, you see there are many places that are less dense than water (like air) and the ship as a whole is less dense than the water.
* So what is the density of an egg?
	* Egg density differs with the amount of shell, the amount of time after laying (which is how you can tell the "freshness" of an egg!) and time of day of lay (eggs laid in the morning have a higher specific gravity)

* Scientists use this same experiment to determine how likely an egg will break during handling
	* Several solutions of salt water are prepared each with a varying specific gravity

* Specific Gravity can be used to determine an egg shell's strength non-destructively.

* Salt water has a specific gravity of about 1.025 at 3.5% salt. Every kilogram-litre of sea water has about 35 grams of dissolved salt.

* Talk about the Dead Sea and show some pictures of people reading the newspaper while floating
* Talk about the Great Salt Lake
* Talk about submarines
* Talk about boats/cruise ships, etc 

* Water's density changes with temperature; colder water is less dense than warmer. Colder water therefore floats.

* Recall that water molecules have a dipole (asymetric distribution of electrical charge). This charge distribution makes it an excellent solvent. Water dissolves many substances by surrounding charged particles and "pulling" them into solution. Salt (NaCl) is an _ionic_ substance that contains alternating sodium and chlorine ions.

* Show the kids what a gram of steel looks like, how people measure with it
* Talk about how the mass of atoms can be known
