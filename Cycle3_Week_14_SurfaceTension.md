# Surface Tension

## Grammar
* *Cohesion* - attraction to like materials; causes surface tension
* *Adhesion* - attraction to other materials; water's attracted to the walls of their containers. We observe this as the water "climbs" the walls of the container
* *Surface tension* - the property of the surface of a liquid that allows it to resist an external force, due to the *cohesive* nature of its molecules
* *Capillary action* - water climbs up the walls of a container 
* *[Meniscus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meniscus)* - the curved surface at the top of a loumn of liquid. _[images](http://bit.ly/1z8XjNN)_
* *Polarity* - the separation of electric charge leading to a molecule having an electric dipole or multipole moment. _Polar molecules_ interact through _dipole--dipole intermollecular forces_ and _hydrogen bonds_
* Molecules are considered *polar* or *nonpolar*

## Practical Applications of Surface Tension

* Detect if liver is working properly - bile lowers surface tension of urine; if bile in urine, liver's not doing its job well
* Camping: Tent gets rain drops on it, but if you touch it, you break the surface tension and the water drips in your tent
* Detergents: water is too bound to itself, it's "clumpy". The soap breaks the surface tension of the water, breaking the "clumps", allowing it to get into the smaller cracks of your skin. Further, detergent in laundry breaks down water.
* The Marangoni Effect

## Cool Images
* Water's surface tension creates a skin-like layer ontop of this swimmer, captured by this [image](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/08/17/article-2190033-1496C97B000005DC-552_964x642.jpg), and [this one](http://i.imgur.com/L72xtFn.jpg)
* Water's surface tension is also what allows bugs like [this spider](http://www.stellarcenter.txstate.edu/images/imagelibrary/spring_workshop_2012/44.jpg) to walk on water

## Comments
Our experiment directly shows how alcohol disturbs the surface tension of water. Last week we learned how molecules are attracted to each other and how sometimes that attraction is very close and at other times sparse. We saw how water molecules, though attracted to each other, are sparsely connected, allowing the alcohol molecules to _fit in between_ the water ones. We can talk about a kind of molecular attraction, _polar dipole--dipole_ attraction that bonds water to other water molecules.
