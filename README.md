A place to put my notes on science segment for Classical Converations cycles

I'm a tutor with a [Classical Conversations](https://www.classicalconversations.com/) community in 
Sun Prairie, Wisconsin. As such, I like to deep-dive on the science segments and I've been putting notes in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
on [Dropbox](http://getdrobox.com). I figured more people might benefit from these, so I made them public.

Enjoy!
